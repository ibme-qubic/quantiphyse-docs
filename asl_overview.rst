ASL Data Processing
===================

- *Widgets -> ASL -> ASL data processing*

This widget provides a complete pipeline for Arterial Spin Labelling MRI analysis using the Fabber 
Bayesian model fitting framework. The pipeline is designed for brain ASL MRI scans and some
of the options assume this, however with care it could be used for other types of ASL scan.

The widget is quite complex and the options are spread across a number of tabs which we will describe 
in turn.
