ASL Analysis
============

- *Widgets -> ASL*

A number of widgets are provided for use in processing Arterial Spin Labelling MRI analysis using the Fabber Bayesian model 
fitting framework.

 - `ASL preprocessing <asl_preproc.rst>`_ - basic preprocessing of ASL data such as tag-control subtraction and generation of perfusion-weighted images
 - `ASL model fitting <asl.rst>`_ - Bayesian model fitting for ASL data generating parameter maps for perfusion, arrival time and other parameters
 - `Multiphase ASL <asl_multiphase.rst>`_ - Pre-processing step for multiphase ASL producing output suitable for standard ASL model fitting
