T1 map from VFA images
======================

*Widgets -> T1 -> VFA T1*

This widget generates T1 maps from variable flip angle images. This is often used as a preprocessing step for 
PK modelling. The VFA scans can be loaded either as separate volumes, one for each flip angle, or a single multi-volume 
file containing all the flip angles.
