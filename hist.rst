Histogram widget
================

*Widgets -> Analysis -> Histogram*

The histogram widget plots a histogram of data values

Any number of data sets can be selected, and the data can be restricted to within a region
of interest. Either the frequency or the probability density can be plotted on the Y axis.

The ``All Volumes`` option applies to 4D data and selects whether the histogram is taken over
the full 4D data or just the current visible volume.

*Example*

This example shows a histogram plotted for two data sets within an ROI ``mask``:
